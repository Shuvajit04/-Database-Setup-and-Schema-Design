# -Database-Setup-and-Schema-Design
ðŸ“˜ How I Created the Library Management System Database
To complete this task, I used MySQL Workbench as the database design tool. I began by creating a new database named LibraryDB using the CREATE DATABASE and USE commands. After choosing the Library Management System as the domain, I identified the key entities required: Books, Authors, Categories, Members, Loans, and a junction table BookAuthors to handle the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.

I then wrote CREATE TABLE statements for each of these entities. For each table, I defined a primary key using AUTO_INCREMENT fields such as BookID, AuthorID, and MemberID to uniquely identify each record. Next, I added foreign keys to define relationships between the tablesâ€”for example, CategoryID in the Books table references Categories, and the BookAuthors table links both BookID and AuthorID as foreign keys.

After setting up all the tables and relationships, I used SQL commands like SHOW TABLES, DESCRIBE Books, and SELECT * FROM Books to verify that everything was working as expected. Finally, I used the EER Diagram feature in MySQL Workbench to visually represent the schema and confirm that the relationships were correctly implemented.
